msgid "Back in the days CSS optimization was easy; put all CSS in your head, aggregating everything in one CSS-file per media-type and you were good to go. But ever since Google included mobile in PageSpeed Insights and started complaining about redering blocking CSS, things got messy (see \"deferring CSS\" elsewhere in this FAQ). One of the solutions is inlining all your CSS, which as of Autoptimize 1.8.0 is supported."
msgstr ""

#. Found in faq paragraph.
msgid "Inlining all CSS has one clear advantage (better PageSpeed score) and one big disadvantage; your base HTML-page gets significantly bigger. The fact that the HTML gets heavier as such is not a huge issue; when looking at performance for a single page request/ response, performance will be better, as there's no overhead of one or more extra requests for CSS-files. But when looking at a test that includes multiple requests (let's say 5), performance will be worse, as the CSS-payload is sent over whereas normally the seperate CSS-files would not need to be sent any more as they would be in cache."
msgstr ""

#. Found in faq paragraph.
msgid "So the choice should be based on your answer to some site-specific questions; what is your site's bounce rate? How many pages per visit do your visitors request? If you have a high bounce rate and a low number of average pages per visit, inlining CSS looks like a good idea. But with a high number of pages/ visit, it's probably not a good idea. Except if all you care about is a stellar PageSpeed-score, off course."
